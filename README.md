The purpose of this project is to design and implement a micro-programming multi-Cycle processor with the following features.
The processor has 8-bit data and 13-bit address. The memory has a capacity of 8*8192 bits, instructions are 8 or 16 bits, and all opcodes are 3 or 4 bits long.
we design this prossor without clock and it doesnt have controll unit . This processor is implemented by micro-programming method !!!
